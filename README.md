# CPU-Design
CPU Design using Logisim-Evolution.

I used Logisim-Evolution and what I have learned in Computer Architecture and Organization to design my own simplified CPU that can perform addition and subtraction. I designed my own assembly language to write a program that would be uploaded into the CPU and made an assembler in python to assemble the program so it would be in the right format to be loaded into the CPU.
